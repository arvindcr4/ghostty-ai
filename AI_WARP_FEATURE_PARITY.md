# Ghostty AI Features - Warp Terminal Parity Roadmap

## Current Status
Ghostty's AI implementation is **functionally complete** with core features working. To achieve full parity with Warp terminal, here are the remaining features to implement:

## New BD Tasks Created for Warp Parity

### 1. **ghostty-l01** - AI Command Suggestions
Add AI-powered command suggestions that appear inline as users type, similar to Warp's autocomplete feature.

### 2. **ghostty-yt0** - AI Error Detection & Fixes
Implement automatic error detection in command output with AI-suggested fixes, similar to Warp's error help feature.

### 3. **ghostty-4lo** - AI Workflow Automation
Add AI workflow features like automatic script generation, command chaining suggestions, and workflow optimization.

### 4. **ghostty-vuk** - AI Chat Persistence
Implement persistent AI chat history across sessions, allowing users to reference previous AI conversations.

### 5. **ghostty-sty** - Inline AI Explanations
Implement hover tooltips with AI explanations for commands, flags, and outputs.

### 6. **ghostty-30t** - AI-Powered Search
Add AI-enhanced search through command history with natural language queries.

### 7. **ghostty-r1h** - Collaborative AI Features
Implement sharing AI sessions, team prompt libraries, and collaborative AI debugging.

### 8. **ghostty-4d4** - AI Learning from Patterns
Add AI that learns from user's command patterns and suggests personalized shortcuts.

### 9. **ghostty-37t** - AI Code Execution Suggestions
Add AI suggestions for code execution with safety warnings.

### 10. **ghostty-842** - Multi-line Command Composition
Implement AI-assisted multi-line command composition with syntax highlighting.

### 11. **ghostty-036** - Voice Input Support
Implement voice-to-text for AI queries.

### 12. **ghostty-ddg** - Performance Analytics
Add AI-powered performance analysis of commands with timing predictions.

## Implementation Priority
All tasks are set to P2 priority and can be implemented incrementally to achieve full Warp terminal parity.

## Current Foundation
The existing AI implementation provides a solid foundation with:
- Core AI assistant functionality
- Multi-provider support
- Template system
- Terminal integration
- GTK4 UI

These new features will build upon this foundation to match Warp's advanced AI capabilities.
